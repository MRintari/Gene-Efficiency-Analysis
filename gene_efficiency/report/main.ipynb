Furthermore, studies have shown that mRNA transcripts can be stored and not immediately translated [@Shyu2008-ch], meaning the genes would require a longer half-life to ensure later translation.

However, although significance is present, the magnitude of the difference is low (`r abs(median(lack_introns_Cop$mRNA_copies_per_cell) - median(have_introns_Cop$mRNA_copies_per_cell))`), therefore the difference will be deemed insignificant.\n",

With the presence of introns appearing to increase mRNA stability, it could be hypothesised that the assembly of the spliceosome increases mRNA stability. This is supported by a study from Lu and Cullen [-@Lu2003-vx], in which they found that the absence of introns resulted in substantially less stable mRNA transcripts. Another study by Wang et al. [-@Wang2007-up] \"found that human intron-containing genes have more stable mRNAs than intron-less genes\". Assembly of the spliceosome requires a significant amount of energy consumption as many proteins must be synthesised for the spliceosome to be produced, with identification and removal of introns requiring further energy consumption. Furthermore, synthesis of these introns, only for them to be spliced and degraded can be deemed as a waste of energy (albeit important for regulatory purposes), therefore the presence of introns is paradoxical to bettering a gene's energy efficiency. However, it can be argued that the presence of introns allows for alternative splicing, a process that enables a single gene to code for multiple proteins. Without introns, the cell would have to store more genes and undergo a greater degree of transcription, requiring more energy. \n",

    "From Figure \\@ref(fig:ess-eff-plot), we can see that there is a significant increase in the number of non-essential genes present amongst the group of `Efficient` genes, further suggesting that non-essential genes are more efficient. As essential genes are required for the cell's survival, it can be hypothesised that they were never able to evolve to become efficient, as they became fixed in the genome due to their importance towards *S. pombe*'s survival. In contrast, non-essential genes did not need to be fixed, enabling a greater degree of adaptability in the gene to make it more efficient. As a result, the non-essential genes have become more efficient than their essential counterparts.\n",

    "It can be predicted that the correlation that was seen between `mRNA_copies_per_cell` and `mRNA.stabilities` will translate to a correlation with `protein_copies_per_cell`. To assess this, we can visualise the relationship between the values by recreating Figure \\@ref(fig:mSta-mCop-plot), however, instead of using colour to represent the efficiency of the genes, we can use colour to represent the number of proteins produced from each transcript. This can be seen in Figure \\@ref(fig:mSta-mCop-pCop-plot). \n",

    "(ref:mSta-mCop-pCop-plot) mRNA half-life plotted against the number of mRNA transcripts per cell, with both variables being on a base-10 logarithmic scale. Colour represents how many protein copies a gene has produced in the cell on a base-10 logarithmic scale. Each logarithmic value was then rounded to the nearest 0.5, where they were converted into ordinal variables. A strong positive correlation can be found between the number of mRNA transcripts produced and the number of protein copies produced. "

    "A correlation coefficient value of `r round(pCop_test[6], 3)` (3 s.f.) between `protein_copies_per_cell` and `mRNA_copies_per_cell` suggests that there is a strong positive correlation between the two. This is expected as it is likely that each transcript is translated into a protein. A correlation coefficient value of `r round(pCop_test[3], 3)` (3 s.f.) between `mRNA.stabilities` and `protein_copies_per_cell` suggests that there is a moderately positive correlation between the two variables, possibly due to the activity of micro-RNAs (miRNA). The number of protein copies produced from a gene may decrease when mRNA half-life decreases due to the presence of multiple miRNA target sites in the gene [@Shyu2008-ch]. If a gene has multiple miRNA target sites, then it is more likely that miRNAs will bind and degrade the mRNA, reducing its half-life and intervening in the expression of that protein. This would then result in a decrease in the number of protein copies of a gene in the cell, therefore this correlation may be powered by the presence of miRNA target sites.\n",

    "# Conclusion {.unnumbered #conclusion}\n",
    "In conclusion, mRNA stability appears to be the characteristic that most strongly indicates the energy efficiency of a gene in *s. pombe* during transcription. mRNA stability has a positive correlation with transcription frequency, and with the number of introns present in a gene, as supported by previous studies. Further analysis of the energy efficiency of genes during transcription would involve assessing the localisation of these proteins, and investigating if certain locations harbour genes of greater energy efficiency. A brief analysis of the energy efficiency of a gene during translation provided evidence for a correlation between the number of protein copies present and its mRNA stability. This may be due to the presence of miRNA target sites; however, further analysis would be required to assess the likelihood of this being true. Future analysis of the energy efficiency of genes during translation could focus on protein half-life and its relationship with various factors. \n",
