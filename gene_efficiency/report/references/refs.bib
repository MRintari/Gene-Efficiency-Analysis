              more than 100-fold in eukaryotic cells. mRNA stabilities can be
              regulated by sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which
              bind to regulatory sequence elements and modulate the interaction
              of the mRNA with the cellular RNA degradation machinery. However,
              it is unclear if this kind of regulation is sufficient to explain
              the large range of mRNA stabilities. To address this question, we
              examined the transcriptome of 74 Schizosaccharomyces pombe
              strains carrying deletions in non-essential genes encoding
              predicted RBPs (86\% of all such genes). We identified 25 strains
              that displayed changes in the levels of between 4 and 104 mRNAs.
              The putative targets of these RBPs formed biologically coherent
              groups, defining regulons involved in cell separation, ribosome
              biogenesis, meiotic progression, stress responses and
              mitochondrial function. Moreover, mRNAs in these groups were
              enriched in specific sequence motifs in their coding sequences

              the posttranscriptional level. We performed genome-wide RNA
              stability measurements for several RBP mutants, and confirmed
              that the altered mRNA levels were caused by changes in their
              stabilities. Although RBPs regulate the decay rates of multiple
              regulons, only 16\% of all S. pombe mRNAs were affected in any of
              the 74 deletion strains. This suggests that other players or

              mechanisms responsible for lineage-specific expansions of genome
              size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular species. One idea
              is that all excess DNA is mutationally hazardous, but weakly
              enough so that genome-size expansion passively emerges in species
              experiencing relatively low efficiency of selection owing to
              small effective population sizes. Another idea is that
              substantial gene additions were impossible without the energetic
              boost provided by the colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic
              lineage. Contrary to this latter view, analysis of cellular
              energetics and genomics data from a wide variety of species
              indicates that, relative to the lifetime ATP requirements of a
              cell, the costs of a gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels
              decline with cell volume in both bacteria and eukaryotes.
              Moreover, these costs are usually sufficiently large to be
              perceived by natural selection in bacterial populations, but not
              in eukaryotes experiencing high levels of random genetic drift.
              Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by virtue
              of their large size alone, eukaryotic cells are subject to a
              broader set of opportunities for the colonization of novel genes

              challenge, we used saturating transposon mutagenesis to
              interrogate the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome. We generated 31
              million transposon insertions, a theoretical coverage of 2.4
              insertions per genomic site. We applied a five-state hidden
              Markov model (HMM) to distinguish insertion-depleted regions from

              Based on the HMM, we estimate that 10\% of the insertion depleted

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The control of energy metabolism is fundamental for
              cell growth and function and anomalies in it are implicated in
              complex diseases and ageing. Metabolism in yeast cells can be
              manipulated by supplying different carbon sources: yeast grown on
              glucose rapidly proliferates by fermentation, analogous to tumour
              cells growing by aerobic glycolysis, whereas on non-fermentable
              carbon sources metabolism shifts towards respiration. RESULTS: We
              screened deletion libraries of fission yeast to identify over 200
              genes required for respiratory growth. Growth media and
              auxotrophic mutants strongly influenced respiratory metabolism.
              Most genes uncovered in the mutant screens have not been
              implicated in respiration in budding yeast. We applied
              gene-expression profiling approaches to compare steady-state
              fermentative and respiratory growth and to analyse the dynamic
              adaptation to respiratory growth. The transcript levels of most
              genes functioning in energy metabolism pathways are coherently
              tuned, reflecting anticipated differences in metabolic flows
              between fermenting and respiring cells. We show that acetyl-CoA
              synthase, rather than citrate lyase, is essential for acetyl-CoA
              synthesis in fission yeast. We also investigated the
              transcriptional response to mitochondrial damage by genetic or
              chemical perturbations, defining a retrograde response that
              involves the concerted regulation of distinct groups of nuclear
              genes that may avert harm from mitochondrial malfunction.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a rich framework of the genetic
              and regulatory basis of energy metabolism in fission yeast and
              beyond, and it pinpoints weaknesses of commonly used auxotroph
              mutants for investigating metabolism. As a model for cellular

              nucleotides but often unstable, contribute a substantial and
              diverse portion to pervasive noncoding transcriptomes. Most
              lncRNAs are poorly annotated and understood, although several
              play important roles in gene regulation and diseases. Here we
              systematically uncover and analyze lncRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces
              pombe. Based on RNA-seq data from twelve RNA-processing mutants
              and nine physiological conditions, we identify 5775 novel
              lncRNAs, nearly 4$\times$ the previously annotated lncRNAs. The
              expression of most lncRNAs becomes strongly induced under the
              genetic and physiological perturbations, most notably during late
              meiosis. Most lncRNAs are cryptic and suppressed by three
              RNA-processing pathways: the nuclear exosome, cytoplasmic
              exonuclease, and RNAi. Double-mutant analyses reveal substantial
              coordination and redundancy among these pathways. We classify
              lncRNAs by their dominant pathway into cryptic unstable
              transcripts (CUTs), Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs),
              and Dicer-sensitive unstable transcripts (DUTs). XUTs and DUTs
              are enriched for antisense lncRNAs, while CUTs are often
              bidirectional and actively translated. The cytoplasmic
              exonuclease, along with RNAi, dampens the expression of thousands
              of lncRNAs and mRNAs that become induced during meiosis.
              Antisense lncRNA expression mostly negatively correlates with
              sense mRNA expression in the physiological, but not the genetic
              conditions. Intergenic and bidirectional lncRNAs emerge from
              nucleosome-depleted regions, upstream of positioned nucleosomes.
              Our results highlight both similarities and differences to lncRNA
              regulation in budding yeast. This broad survey of the lncRNA
              repertoire and characteristics in S. pombe, and the interwoven

              post-transcriptionally at various levels in eukaryotes. Once
              transcribed, mRNAs associate with a host of proteins throughout
              their lifetime. These mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) undergo a
              series of remodeling events that are influenced by and/or
              influence the translation and mRNA decay machinery. In this
              review we discuss how a decision to translate or to degrade a
              cytoplasmic mRNA is reached. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)
              and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing are provided as
              examples. NMD is a surveillance mechanism that detects and
              eliminates aberrant mRNAs whose expression would result in
              truncated proteins that are often deleterious to the organism.
              miRNA-mediated mRNA silencing is a mechanism that ensures a given
              protein is expressed at a proper level to permit normal cellular
              function. While NMD and miRNA-mediated mRNA silencing use
              different decision-making processes to determine the fate of
              their targets, both are greatly influenced by mRNP dynamics. In
              addition, both are linked to RNA processing bodies. Possible
              modes involving 3' untranslated region and its associated
              factors, which appear to play key roles in both processes, are

              of human and nonhuman genes in vertebrate cells. Although our
              data demonstrate that splicing invariably enhances the level of
              gene expression, this positive effect is generally moderate.
              However, in the case of the human beta-globin gene, splicing is
              essential for significant protein expression. In the absence of
              introns, 3' end processing is inefficient, and this appears to be
              causally linked to a significant decrease in the level of both
              nuclear and cytoplasmic 3' end-processed RNA. In contrast,
              splicing appears to only modestly enhance nuclear mRNA export.
              Consistent with this observation, intronless beta-globin gene
              expression was only partially rescued by the insertion of
              retroviral nuclear mRNA export elements. Surprisingly, in the
              case of the highly intron dependent beta-globin gene, the mRNA
              that did reach the cytoplasm was also only inefficiently
              translated if it derived from an intronless expression plasmid.
              Together, these data argue that splicing can increase gene
              expression by enhancing mRNA 3' end processing, and hence, mRNA
              production. Moreover, in the case of the highly intron-dependent
              beta-globin gene, splicing also significantly enhanced the

  abstract  = "Abstract Given C samples, with n i observations in the ith
               sample, a test of the hypothesis that the samples are from the
               same population may be made by ranking the observations from
               from 1 to $\Sigma$n i (giving each observation in a group of
               ties the mean of the ranks tied for), finding the C sums of
               ranks, and computing a statistic H. Under the stated hypothesis,
               H is distributed approximately as ?2(C ? 1), unless the samples
               are too small, in which case special approximations or exact
               tables are provided. One of the most important applications of
               the test is in detecting differences among the population
